# Queue

A strongly-typed queue object.

```ts
// Import the queue object.
import Queue from "https://deno.land/x/queue/mod.ts";

// Create a new queue.
const queue = new Queue();

const delay = (ms = 0) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

// Run stuffâ€¦
queue.push(async () => {
	await delay(1000);
	console.log("1");
});
queue.push(async () => {
	console.log("2")
	await delay(1000);
});
queue.push(() => console.log("3"));

console.log("About to start queue");
setTimeout(() => {
	console.log("Starting queue");
	queue.start();
}, 1000);

// You can even wait for your
// function to be executed in
// the queue.

console.log("Adding 4 to queue.");
const value = await queue.push(() => "hello world");
console.log("4 was executed:", value);
```

Outputs:

```
Adding 4 to queue.
1
2
3
4 was executed: hello world
```
